## Welcome to the Github page of the Financial Analysis Dashboard Project.

## Introduction

This project proposes a dashboard that allows the user to perform financial analysis on one or two assets simultaneously. These analyses go from the simple index evolution to more complex analysis like the linear regression. This application is designed to be a useful tool for any person wanting a fast way to have analyses and take investment decisions. This is also useful for educational purposes because the results can easily be incorporated to slides or documents since we can download them directly. In one sentence, the purpose of this application is to make finance more accessible.
